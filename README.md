## Senior Software Engineer, Frontend

### Goal

Implement features for a Vehicle Inventory and Finance Calculator.

### Scenario

Tasked with building a Vehicle listing and Finance Details view feature for an automotive finance web application. The application needs to display a list of retailers' available vehicles, allow users to filter and sort these vehicles, and then view the details of a single vehicle along with a representative finance calculation on a separate page.

# Notes
I was running out of time so I haven't been able to add unit tests. 
I also have only included a very basic design due to time constraints normally I would like to make it a bit prettier than this. 
state, could have probably beinifitted using a state management library like Zustand (redux would have been overkill). But I wanted to keep it simple.
